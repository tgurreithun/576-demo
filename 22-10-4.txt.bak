Notes from 10/4/2022

git: version control software
	only need one copy
	git tracks changes
	tag versions
	support for branching/merging

git basics: 
	Local repo- on your machine (w/ full history)
	remote repo- on another machine that you sync with (collabs have access)
	snapshots (commits)- unit of tracking 
	

GitHub: website that does the fun stuff
	keeps a backup for you
	issue tracking
	pull requests (PRs) -- merging in new functionality
